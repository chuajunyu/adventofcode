    """
    I think this is an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm

    The goal is to create a visited dictionary that maps
    out the minimal cost of going to any point in the cave.

    The stack keeps track of which points in the cave need
    to have the costs of their adjacent blocks (neighbours) updated.

    When a point in the stack is processed, its neighbours have 
    their costs computed, and then the neighbours are added to the stack,
    so that their neighbours can also have their costs computed.

    Points are added to the stack when:
    1. Their costs are computed for the first time (So now their neighbours cost can also be computed)
    2. Their neighbours cost changes, causing them to update their costs (So now their neighbours cost may change)

    The stack is initialised with only the starting point.
    The algorithm ends when the stack is empty, meaning all points have been updated fully.

        # not fully updated, as when they are updated, points near the end will need to be updated again.
